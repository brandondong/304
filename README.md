If developing from home, make sure DatabaseConnection.USE_LOCAL is set to true and configure your environment following http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hazra/tutorials/JDBC/jdbc1.html under "Working from home or wireless".

NEW instructions:
To test a query, add code that creates and executes the query in Application.java. Run Application.java, making sure that the hotel.sql script has been run on your Ugrad database and the changes are commited (execute the command "commit;").
