The project will not compile until DatabaseCredentials.java is created. This is to prevent bots scraping Github from gathering personal information. Changes to this file will be ignored in Git.

If developing from home, make sure DatabaseConnection.USE_LOCAL is set to true and configure your environment following http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hazra/tutorials/JDBC/jdbc1.html under "Working from home or wireless".

To start the REST server on localhost:8080, run Application.java.
